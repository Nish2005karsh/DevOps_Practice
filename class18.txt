CI/CD PIPELINE
What s  Jenkins?
CI/CD stands for continuous integration/continuous deployment(delivery)
Pipeline is group of instructions
CI (Continuous Integration): Automatically building and testing your code every time developers push changes to a shared repository.
CD (Continuous Delivery/Deployment): Automatically deploying the code to staging or production environments after successful tests.
👉 Goal: Deliver code faster, with fewer bugs.

Before contiguous integration


WHy Jenkins
Jenkins is one of the most popular open-source automation servers used for CI/CD because it:
Integrates with GitHub, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, etc.
Supports 1000+ plugins.
Allows both pipeline as code (Jenkinsfile) and GUI-based job creation.

Developer → GitHub → Jenkins (CI Server) → Test/Build → Deploy (CD)
Key Components:

Jenkins Master: Handles scheduling, managing nodes, and UI.

Jenkins Agents (Nodes): Run the jobs (build/test/deploy).

Plugins: For Git, Docker, Maven, etc.

Jenkinsfile: Script that defines the pipeline

Jenkins installation

sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk -y
wget -q -O - https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian/jenkins.io.key | sudo apt-key add -
sudo sh -c 'echo deb http://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list'
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins -y
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
sudo systemctl start jenkins
Step 2: Initial Setup

Open the browser → http://localhost:8080
Get the initial admin password:
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
Install Suggested Plugins.
Create your Admin User.

Step 3: Integrate Jenkins with GitHub

Install Git plugin (if not installed).

In Jenkins:

Create a New Item → Freestyle Project or Pipeline.

Under Source Code Management, choose Git.

Enter your GitHub repo URL.

Add GitHub credentials (PAT or SSH key).

Optionally, configure GitHub Webhooks to trigger Jenkins when code is pushed:

In GitHub → Repo Settings → Webhooks → Add:

http://<your-jenkins-url>:8080/github-webhook

🚀 Step 5: CD – Deploy Automatically

You can add a deployment stage:
Example (Deploying with Docker):
stage('Deploy') {
    steps {
        sh '''
        docker build -t myapp:latest .
        docker stop myapp || true
        docker rm myapp || true
        docker run -d --name myapp -p 8080:8080 myapp:latest
        '''
    }
}

}
You can also deploy to:

AWS EC2 (using SSH)

Kubernetes (using kubectl)

Docker Hub (push images)

Heroku / DigitalOcean / Render

🧩 Step 6: Trigger the Pipeline
You can trigger Jenkins jobs by:

Code push (via GitHub Webhook)

Manual build

Scheduled builds (CRON syntax)
Example:

sql
Copy code
H/5 * * * *  → runs every 5 minutes

📊 Step 7: Monitor and Logs

Check Console Output for logs.

Use Blue Ocean Plugin for a modern UI pipeline visualization.

Configure Email / Slack notifications for failures.

🧱 Common Plugins
Plugin	Purpose
Git Plugin	Integrate with Git
Pipeline	For Jenkinsfile support
Blue Ocean	Modern UI
Docker Pipeline	Docker integration
GitHub Integration	Webhook triggers
Email Extension	Notifications

🧩 Advanced: Jenkins + Docker + Kubernetes

You can:
Run Jenkins in a Docker container.
Use Docker agents for isolated builds.
Deploy to Kubernetes clusters automatically.
