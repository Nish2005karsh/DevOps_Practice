File System Heirarchy in Linux

1.Windows 
C:\
Program File,User,Program,Perflogs
2.Linux
/
|-- bin,/etc,/usr,/boot


/home->home directory  for other users
/root->home directory of root users(super user)
/etc->config files
/usr->consists  of default software
/bin->commands used by other users
/sbin->commands used by root user
/boot->bootable files
/opt->optimal softwarre

Create files in linux
===================
 cat ,touch , vim,nano(vim,nano are editors)
 touch file1,file2,file3->file created 
 cat > file1
 >->means redirect
