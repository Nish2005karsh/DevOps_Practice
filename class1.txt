What is devops?
Its combination of Development and operations
It’s a culture, methodology, and set of tools that bring together software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to:
1->Improve collaboration
2->Automate processes
3->Deliver software faster, more reliably, and with higher quality

DevOps removes the wall between developers (who write code) and operations (who deploy and maintain it).

How devops work 
DevOps follows a continuous lifecycle often represented by the infinity loop (∞).
Each phase feeds into the next, creating a cycle of improvement.

| Phase          | Description                                          | Common Tools                   |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **1. Plan**    | Define features, user stories, and goals             | Jira, Trello, Azure Boards     |
| **2. Code**    | Write application code and configuration             | Git, GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket |
| **3. Build**   | Compile and build software automatically             | Maven, Gradle, Jenkins         |
| **4. Test**    | Run automated tests to ensure quality                | Selenium, JUnit, pytest        |
| **5. Release** | Package and prepare the app for deployment           | Jenkins, GitHub Actions        |
| **6. Deploy**  | Deliver software to production (manual or automated) | Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible    |
| **7. Operate** | Maintain, monitor, and troubleshoot systems          | Prometheus, Grafana, Datadog   |
| **8. Monitor** | Gather metrics to improve future releases            | ELK Stack, New Relic, Splunk   |


➡️ The process is continuous integration (CI) + continuous delivery/deployment (CD) — often called CI/CD.

💡 Example Workflow

Developer pushes code to GitHub

Jenkins detects the push → runs tests → builds Docker image

Image is pushed to Docker Hub

Kubernetes automatically deploys new version

Prometheus monitors uptime and Grafana displays dashboards

Everything happens automatically, reducing human error and speeding up delivery 🚀
