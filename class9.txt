🧱 1. Docker Volumes — (For Data Storage)
subject:"Repository deleted" from:github.com

👉 Containers are temporary — if you stop or delete one, its data disappears.
But real apps (like databases or web apps) need permanent storage — that’s where volumes come in.

Think of volumes as external hard drives for containers.
Let’s say you have a MySQL container:

docker run -d -v mydata:/var/lib/mysql mysql

mydata is the volume name.

/var/lib/mysql is where MySQL stores its data inside the container.

Even if you delete the container, mydata volume keeps the database files safe.
So next time you run the same container, you can reattach it and your data will still be there
✅ Use volumes for:

Databases (MySQL, MongoDB)

Uploads / user data

Config files that need persistence

🌐 2. Docker Networks — (For Communication Between Containers)
Containers are isolated by default, but they often need to talk to each other.
For example, your frontend container needs to talk to your backend container, which talks to your database container.

Docker Networks let them communicate securely and easily.

Example:
docker network create mynetwork


Then connect containers to it:
docker run -d --name backend --network mynetwork myapp-backend
docker run -d --name db --network mynetwork mysql

Now your backend can reach the database using db:3306 (service name as hostname).✅ Use networks for:

Linking app layers (frontend ↔ backend ↔ database)

Avoiding exposing containers to the public Internet

Creating microservices-style connections

⚙️ 3. Docker Daemon (dockerd) — (The Brain of Docker)
When you install Docker, you actually get two parts:

Docker Client → what you use (docker run, docker build, etc.)

Docker Daemon → the background process that actually does the work.

🧠 The daemon is like Docker’s engine — it:

Builds and runs containers

Manages images, volumes, networks

Listens for API requests from the client

So when you type:

docker run nginx


The client sends this to the daemon, which downloads the image, starts the container, and manages it behind the scenes.

✅ In short:

Docker Client = what you interact with

Docker Daemon = does the heavy lifting

🧩 4. Docker Compose — (For Managing Multi-Container Apps)

Typing long docker run commands for 3–5 containers is painful 😅.
Docker Compose fixes that — it uses a simple YAML file (docker-compose.yml) to define all containers, networks, and volumes in one place.

Example:
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: nginx
    ports:
      - "80:80"
  db:
    image: mysql
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
    volumes:
      - mydata:/var/lib/mysql
volumes:
  mydata:


Then just run:

docker-compose up -d


This spins up both the web and db containers together, with volumes and networks automatically created.

✅ Use Docker Compose for:

Multi-container apps

Easier local development

Replicating production environments
🧩 Quick Analogy (to tie it all together)
| Concept            | Analogy                                              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Docker Daemon**  | The engine running everything (like the car engine)  |
| **Container**      | The running car                                      |
| **Image**          | The car’s blueprint or design                        |
| **Volume**         | The trunk where data is stored                       |
| **Network**        | The road that connects cars                          |
| **Docker Compose** | The traffic manager — controls multiple cars at once |




Docker compose

1. Create and start containers defined in a docker-compose.yml
docker compose up
This command reads the docker-compose.yml file and
starts the defined services in the background.

2. Stop and remove containers defined in a docker-compose.yml
docker compose down
This command stops & removes the containers, networks,
and volumes defined in the docker-compose.yml file.

3. Build or rebuild services:
docker compose build
This command builds or rebuilds the Docker images for the
services defined in the docker compose.yml file

4. List containers for a specific Docker Compose project
docker compose ps
This command lists the containers for the services defined
in the docker-compose.yml file.

  5. View logs for services:
  docker compose logs

  This command shows the logs for all services defined in the
docker-compose.yml file.

6. Scale services to a specific number of containers:
docker compose up -d --scale service_name =number_of_containers
#Example
docker compose up  -d --scale web=3

7. Run a one-time command in a service:
docker compose run service_name command
#Example
docker compose rub web npm install

8. List all volumes:
docker volume ls
Docker Compose creates volumes for services. This
command helps you see them.

9. Pause a service:
docker volume pause service_name
This command pauses the specified service.

10.Unpause a service:
docker volume unpause service_name
This command unpauses the specified service.

11. View details of a service:
docker compose ps service_name
Provides detailed information about a specific service.

Latest Docker
1. Initialize Docker inside an application
docker init

2. Watch the service/container of an application
docker compose watch

It watches build context for service and rebuild/refresh
containers when files are updated
