Why before docker ?

Before Docker existed (pre-2013), developers and operations teams had a huge pain point:
“It works on my machine!”
You’d write an app in Node.js 18, but your teammate had Node.js 16 — and the app wouldn’t run.
Production servers might have different libraries, OS versions, or dependencies.
Setting up environments for each project took hours (installing Python, MySQL, Redis, etc.).
Scaling apps meant manually configuring servers and copying code.

So the world needed a standard, portable environment where:
You can package your app and everything it needs.
You can run it anywhere — laptop, server, or cloud — with identical behavior.
The Solution → Docker

Docker has 2 parts called as image and container
Docker->A container is like a mini computer that includes apps dependencies +runtime
Docker image->Blue print of that container
Docker containers are a running instance of docker images

Docker = A universal shipping container for software.
