Kubernetes
Configuration management tools like ansible and chef
Why before docker ?

Before Docker existed (pre-2013), developers and operations teams had a huge pain point:
“It works on my machine!”
You’d write an app in Node.js 18, but your teammate had Node.js 16 — and the app wouldn’t run.
Production servers might have different libraries, OS versions, or dependencies.
Setting up environments for each project took hours (installing Python, MySQL, Redis, etc.).
Scaling apps meant manually configuring servers and copying code.
