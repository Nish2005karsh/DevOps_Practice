Managing Deployment using Kubernetes engine
Kubernetes is used to manage the docker containers

Overview:
Dev Ops practices will regularly make use of multiple deployments to manage application deployment scenarios such as "Continuous deployment", "Blue-Green deployments", "Canary deployments" and more. This lab teaches you how to scale and manage containers so you can accomplish these common scenarios where multiple heterogeneous deployments are being used.

In this lab , i:
Use the kubectl tool
Create deployment yaml files
Launch, update, and scale deployments

Initial Setup
1.Set the zone
commd->gcloud config set compute/zone us-east-4-b.
gcloud->google cloud

2.Get the sample code
commd->gcloud storage cp -r gs://spls/gsp053/kubernetes.
cd kubernetes

3.Create a cluster(takes a feew minutes)
gcloud container clusters create bootcamp\--machine-type e2-small \--num-nodes 3
\--scopes "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/projecthosting,storage-rw"

Step2:Create deployment

# View the deployment configuration
1.cat deployment/fortune-app-blue.yaml
#Create deployment

kubectl create -f deployments/fortune-app-blue.yaml

#Verify deployments
kubectl get deployments

#Verify replicaset
kubectl get replicasets

#verify  the pods
kubectl get pods

#Create services
kubectl create -f services/fortune-app.yaml

#Get service external IP
kubectl get services fortune-app

#test the service
curl http://`kubectl get svc fortune-app -o =jsonpath="{status.loadBalancer.ingres[0].ip}"`\version

3.Scaling deployment
#Scale upto 5 replicas

kubectl scale deployment fortune-app-blue --replicas=5

#Verify count(should show  5)
kubectl get pods | grep fortune-app-blue | wc -1

#Scae back to three(3) replicas
kubectl scale deployment fortune-app-blue --replicas=3

#Verify count(should show 3)
kubectl get pods | grep fortune-blue-app |  wc -1

4.Rolling updates
# Edit the deployment (interactive step)
kubectl edit deployment fortune-app-blue
