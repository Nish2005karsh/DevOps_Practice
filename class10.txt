Docker file
A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions for
building a Docker image. It defines the base image, sets up
environment variables, installs software, and configures
the container for a specific application or service.

Docker File Syntax
Specifies the base image for the Docker image

FROM image_name :tag
#Example
FROM ubuntu:20.04

WORKDIR:
Sets the working directory for subsequent instructions

WORKDIR /path/to/directory
# Example
WORKDIR /app

COPY:
Copies files or directories from the build context to the
container

COPY host_source_path container_destination_path
#Example
copy . .

RUN:
Executes commands in the shell.
RUN command1 && command2
#Example
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl

ENV:
Sets environment variables in the image.
ENV KEY=VALUE
#Example
ENV NODE_VERSION=14

EXPOSE:
Informs Docker that the container listens on specified
network ports at runtime.

EXPOSE PORT
#Example
EXPOSE 8080

CMD:
Provides default commands or parameters for an
executing container.
CMD ["executable","param1","param2"]
# Example
CMD ["npm", "start"]

or 
CMD executable param1 param2
#Example
CMD npm run dev

ENTRYPOINT:
ENTRYPOINT ["executable","param1","param2"]
#Example
ENTRYPOINT["node.js","app.js"]
or
ENTRYPOINT executable param1 param2
ENTRYPOINT node app.js

ARG:
Defines variables that users can pass at build-time to the
builder with the docker build command.

ARG VARIABLE_NAME=default_value
# Example
ARG VERSION=latest
VOLUME:
Creates a mount point for external volumes or other
containers.

VOLUME /path/to/volume
# Example
VOLUME /data

LABEL:
Adds metadata to an image in the form of key-value pairs.
LABEL key="value"
#Example
LABEL version ="1.0" maintainer ="Nishkarsh"

USER:
Specifies the username or UID to use when running the
image
USER user_name
#Example
USER app

ADD:
Copies files or directories and can extract tarballs in the
process.

ADD source_path destination_path
# Example
ADD ./app.tar.gz /app

# Use an official Node.js runtime as a base image
